# Stock-Market-Data-Visualisation
Stock markets are constantly changing. It is difficult to predict the stock market’s fluctuations because of the many factors at play. Similarly, it is difficult to create models to consider such variability. However, due to recent advances in machine learning and computing, machines can now process large amounts of data. This enables us to use stock exchange data from the past to analyse trends and predict future changes.
This project will leverage Python to analyse stock data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks. You can visualize the top 5 highest valued technology stocks, as of the end of the 2022:

•	Microsoft (MSFT)

•	Amazon (AMZN)

•	Apple (AAPL)

•	Alphabet (GOOG)

•	Facebook (FB).

Use pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally look at a few ways of analysing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history.
In your analysis you will perform the following:
1.	Visualize the stock prices using matplotlib
2.	Calculate and visualize the daily simple rate of return
3.	Calculate and visualize the mean rates of return 
4.	Calculate and visualize the variances of the returns
5.	Calculate and visualize the standard deviations of the returns
6.	Write a short thesis based on the correlations between the tech stocks
