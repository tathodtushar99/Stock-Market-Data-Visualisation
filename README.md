# Stock-Market-Data-Visualisation

Stock markets are constantly changing. The many factors at play make it difficult to predict the stock market’s fluctuations. Similarly, it isn't easy to create models that consider such variability. However, due to recent advances in machine learning and computing, machines can now process large amounts of data. This enables us to use stock exchange data from the past to analyze trends and predict future changes.
This project will leverage Python to analyze stock data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks. You can visualize the top 5 most valued technology stocks as of the end of 2022:

•	Microsoft (MSFT)

•	Amazon (AMZN)

•	Apple (AAPL)

•	Alphabet (GOOG)

•	Facebook (FB).

Use pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally look at a few ways of analysing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history.

In your analysis, you will perform the following:

1.	Visualize the stock prices using matplotlib
2.	Calculate and visualize the daily simple rate of return
3.	Calculate and visualize the mean rates of return 
4.	Calculate and visualize the variances of the returns
5.	Calculate and visualize the standard deviations of the returns
6.	Write a short thesis based on the correlations between the tech stocks
